* What is gobrew?

Simply put, gobrew lets you easily switch between multiple versions of go. It is based on [[https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv][rbenv]] and [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]].

* Why gobrew?

Often times you'll be developing against one version of Go when another version is released (or perhaps a release candidate is made available). Having
to download multiple versions, configure your path again and again you can use one simple tool.

* Get gobrewing

1. Clone the repository

    git clone git://github.com/grobins2/gobrew.git ~/.gobrew

2. Update your shell config

    export PATH="$HOME/.gobrew/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(gobrew init -)"

3. List available versions

    gobrew list

4. Install Go

    gobrew install 1.2

note: there's a [[https://github.com/grobins2/gobrew/issues/7][bug]] in gobrew which doesn't allow go version 1.2 to be installed on Mac OS X.

* Contribute

Give [[https://github.com/grobins2/gobrew][gobrew]] a shot, fork it or submit issues and let's make it the best Go version manager around. If you're
interested, check out [[https://github.com/mindscratch/gobrew_fw][gobrew::fw]] as well.
