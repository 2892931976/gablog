In this penultimate post we'd like to recap the contributions by our fantastic authors.

So far this year's Go Advent has generated 56k TODO(dfc) unique page views and exists as a permanent resource for the future.

Heading into the second week, [[https://plus.google.com/+ElliottStoneham/about][Elliott Stoneham]] explained on [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-08-dr-who-and-the-mutant-go-compilers][day 8]] how he used [[http://haxe.org/][haxe]], the Go SSA package and a sonic screwdriver to translate Go code into JavaScript.

On [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-09-building-a-weather-app-using-go][day 9]] it was [[https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet][William Kennedy]]'s turn to explain how he launched [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outcast-noaa-radar-hourly/id739808997?mt=8][Outcast]], an iOS application, using a back end powered entirely by Go.

[[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-10-beyond-static-binaries][Day 10]] bought us an expose on using Go on the other side of the Devops equation from Joseph Holsten.

The incorrigible recidivist, Jeremy Saenz brought a little Christmas cheer with a Martini web application for recording wish lists for [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-11-martini][day 11]].

Not content with the day 1 spot, Andrew Gerrand was back on [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-12-inside-the-go-playground][day 12]] to lift the lid on one of Go's greatest mysteries: how does the Go Playground work?

For [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-13-tiger-tonic][day 13]] Richard Crowley, author of the popular GoAgain zero downtime restart package, told us all about his other labor of love, Tiger Tonic.

On [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-18-go-outside][day 18]] Tony Wilson instructed us all to Go Outside. This is always good advice, and in this case in particular, extremely useful if you need to call functions in shared objects (or DLLs) from Go.

In his post for [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-19-eject-the-web][day 19]] Yasuhiro MATSUMOTO, author of the beloved go-sqlite3, discussed cross platform Go projects and the benefits of Go for UI development.

Thank you to all of you for contributing your articles, time, and experiences about using Go in the real world.

* One more post to go

Like all great performances we've arranged an encore, and just like the encore you'll have to wait. 

Tomorrow, amongst the wrapping paper and gifts, we'll be announcing the names of the GopherCon 2014 presenters.
